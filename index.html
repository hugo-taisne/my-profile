		<p>Hello, my name is Hugo, I am 20 years old and I am in my second year at IESEG. I arrived in France only five years ago. I used to live in Hawaii, which is where I discovered my true passion for surfing. </p>

		<h2>Surf 🏄 </h2>
		<p>Although it's a big cliché, it's true that in Hawaii, everyone surfs. I started surfing when I was 10 years old. Surfing gives me a lot of joy, both because the natural environment is very soothing and because I simply enjoy the sport. The biggest wave I have ever surfed was approximately eight meters.

		<h2>Studies 📚</h2>
		<p>I am in my third year of business school at IESEG. I would have loved to go on a university exchange to a country by the sea where it would be easy to surf. However, I decided to try to discover new countries and new cultures, so I am finally going to Seoul. </p>

		<h2>Photography 📷 </h2>
		<p>
		 
I love photography. It's a faster process than drawing which fascinates me. I am always equipped with my Nikon SLR and I try to capture every moment. I take a lot of pictures of my friends but I also like less realistic and more abstract pictures. My favorite photographers are Steve McCurry and David Lachapelle.
